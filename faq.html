        <dl>
            <dt>
                What should I expect during my psychiatric intake assessment (for medication management)?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p style="background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Intake assessments typically take up to 90 minutes including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&#11041; A detailed psychiatric history</li>
                    <li>&#11041; Review of symptoms (both psychiatric and mental)</li>
                    <li>&#11041; Open discussion of treatment options</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are interested in discussing a specific diagnosis or service (such as ADHD or genetic testing), please make that clear at the beginning of the session to facilitate time management.  When seeing children, we try to allow for time with parents in the room as well as some time without parents present unless clients prefer otherwise.  If the client is under 14 years old they should be accompanied by a legal guardian.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Do you take insurance?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Yes, we work with many insurances but please note that it is up to <em style="font-style: italic;">you</em> to know if you are covered. Go to our <a href="insurance.html" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Insurance page here</a> to check for your insurance.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                What are your fees?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Fees vary depending on services and appointment times.<br>
                If you are interested in paying out of pocket we can discuss all potential fees in advance of appointments to give an idea of how to budget for ongoing appointments and avoid any unexpected charges.</p>
            
            </dd>

            <dt>
                What ages do you treat?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We treat all ages with appropriate services across the lifespan (though not all therapies, medications, or other services are appropriate for each client).</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>What type of disorders do you treat?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We treat a wide range of mental health and general health related issues.<br> 
                Staff have varying expertise so it's best to discuss specific interests, diagnoses, and/or symptoms upfront to ensure that treatment will be best suited to client needs.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>What's your treatment philosophy?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We believe that various struggles and challenges can overwhelm existing coping skills, leaving the brain and body feeling stuck. We strive to teach new coping skills by allowing development of new tactics opening the brain and body to renewed confidence and hope.  In that sense, we understand the most difficult and painful lessons can often become our most unique superpowers.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                What services do you offer?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We offer a wide range of services from medication management to genetic testing. Please visit our <a href="insurance.html" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;"> Services page here</a> to see our full list of offerings.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                Do you prescribe controlled substances?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We do prescribe controlled substances at our discretion with the goal of using them rarely or temporarily.<br>
                Please note if you are prescribed a controlled substance you will be asked to sign a controlled substance agreement and submit to randomized drug screens.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                Am I required to enter my credit card information in the portal?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Entering credit card information is optional.<br>
                If you choose to enter your credit card information automatically charge co-pays and outstanding balances.  If you prefer to be invoiced simply don't enter any credit card information.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                What is your cancellation / missed appointment policy?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We require a notice of at least 2 business days (48 hours) to cancel or change your appointment without any penalties.<br>
                You can cancel by calling the office, texting the main number, or messaging through the patient portal.  If you have Medicaid or Medicare and you miss or late cancel up to 3 appointments in a rolling calendar year, you could risk losing services. If you have private insurance, the first missed or late cancellation is free, the second is $50, and from then on you will be charged the full fee. It will be your responsibility to pay the fee.  We have arranged for appointment reminders to go out 3 business days before your appt. to allow a full day for cancelation without penalty.  Please be aware this policy is strictly enforced as there is a high need for appointments currently.</p>
